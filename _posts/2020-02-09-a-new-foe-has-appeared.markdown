Introduction
============
The idea to finally set up my own blog stems from my first malware analysis where a word document was spotted on Twitter by one of my colleague. Following the Twitter thread shows that some researchers had already did some preliminary analysis but the main payload still needed to be unpacked and analized. After reaching out to one of the researcher (@Arkbird_SOLG) I was directed to a great tutorial about how to unpack python executable (https://infosecuritygeek.com/reversing-a-simple-python-ransomware/)
