So since I haven't wrote any blog post here for a while and that a friend of mine asked for some pointer on malware analysis using Radare2, I though I would give a try to radare2!

First of all, I only used radare2/R2 a couple of time before so I'll mostly follow what is showed in this [presentation][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnZLy_sq-nY&feature=emb_logo]
