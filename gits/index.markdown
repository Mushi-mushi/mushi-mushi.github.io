AutoRecon
==========
>AutoRecon is a multi-threaded network reconnaissance tool which performs automated enumeration of services. It is intended as a time-saving tool for use in CTFs and other penetration testing environments (e.g. OSCP). It may also be useful in real-world engagements.
- [AutoRecon][link1]

Stego-toolkit
=============
>This project is a Docker image useful for solving Steganography challenges as those you can find at CTF platforms like hackthebox.eu. The image comes pre-installed with many popular tools (see list below) and several screening scripts you can use check simple things (for instance, run check_jpg.sh image.jpg to get a report for a JPG file).

PayloadsAllTheThings
====================
>A list of useful payloads and bypasses for Web Application Security. Feel free to improve with your payloads and techniques !
- [PayloadsAllTheThings][link3]

Chisel
======
>Chisel is a fast TCP tunnel, transported over HTTP, secured via SSH. Single executable including both client and server. Written in Go (golang). Chisel is mainly useful for passing through firewalls, though it can also be used to provide a secure endpoint into your network. Chisel is very similar to crowbar though achieves much higher performance.

Evil-winrm
==========
>This shell is the ultimate WinRM shell for hacking/pentesting.
- [Evil-winrm][link5]

Gef
===
>GEF (pronounced ʤɛf - "Jeff") is a set of commands for x86/64, ARM, MIPS, PowerPC and SPARC to assist exploit developers and reverse-engineers when using old school GDB. It provides additional features to GDB using the Python API to assist during the process of dynamic analysis and exploit development.
- [Gef][link6]

Exrex
======
>Exrex is a command line tool and python module that generates all - or random - matching strings to a given regular expression and more. It's pure python, without external dependencies.
- [Exrex][link7]

PEASS
======
>Here you will find privilege escalation tools for Windows and Linux/Unix* (in some near future also for Mac).
- [PEASS][link8]

Movfuscator
===========
>The M/o/Vfuscator (short 'o', sounds like "mobfuscator") compiles programs into "mov" instructions, and only "mov" instructions. Arithmetic, comparisons, jumps, function calls, and everything else a program needs are all performed through mov operations; there is no self-modifying code, no transport-triggered calculation, and no other form of non-mov cheating.
- [Movfuscator][link9]

Unicorn
=======
>Magic Unicorn is a simple tool for using a PowerShell downgrade attack and inject shellcode straight into memory. Based on Matthew Graeber's powershell attacks and the powershell bypass technique presented by David Kennedy (TrustedSec) and Josh Kelly at Defcon 18.
- [Unicorn][link10]

Tpotce
======
>T-Pot is based on a vanilla Ubuntu 14.04.02 ISO image. The honeypot daemons as well as other support components we used have been paravirtualized using docker. This allowed us to run multiple honeypot daemons on the same network interface without problems make the entire system very low maintenance.
